Hello and welcome to my personal homepage! My name is Zichuan Fu, and I am thrilled to share my educational background and aspirations with you.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Xi'an Jiaotong University's School of Software Engineering, where I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree. I was fortunate to be mentored by Professor [Jiakun Zhao](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/zhaojk) during my time there. Following my undergraduate education, I pursued a Master of Science degree in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Sheffield. There, I had the pleasure of working under the guidance of Dr. [Anton Ragni](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/anton-ragni).

I am now excited to embark on my journey as a Ph.D. candidate at City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of Professor [Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/).

As a passionate advocate for artificial general intelligence (AGI), I am eager to contribute my efforts to help bring this revolutionary technology to fruition. I firmly believe that AGI has the potential to reshape our world for the better, and I am committed to playing an active role in its development. Thank you for visiting my page and learning more about my background and aspirations.
